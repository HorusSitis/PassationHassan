\subsection{Three-dimensional case}

Following geometries, especially when the number of nodes in the mesh where Finite Element vector space is defined, fully justify the use of a Reduced Order Model, %
sice time of execution of the Finite Element Method becomes significant.

\par
Like in section \ref{hom_d}, we have chosen three different resolutions of the meshes used for each problem to solve with a ROM. %
These are defined by the number of nodes : $10$, $20$ or $50$, we find on a side of the unit cube.

\par
The following table gives the values of $N_{rom}$ with a threshold of $99,99\%$. We can see that, for a same problem in $\chi (\rho ,\mathbf{y})$, %
$N_{rom}$ depends on the size of the mesh : %
this can be understood mathematically since it has been defined, and calculated, from a Finite Element space. %
The latter is nothing more than an approximation of $L^2$ or $H^1$ we use for our physical problem.

\par
Therefore the physically relevant $N_{rom}$, which might be equal to the mathematical $N_{rom}$ for $L^2$ or $H^1$ functional space, %
is likely to be different of the values we find in the following table, %
and we can reasonably thik it will be lesser than its value for the biggest mesh.

\par
For example, $N_{rom}$ for a physical, spherical inclusion will be lesser than $3$, and lesser than $2$ for two spheres per unit cell.

\par
We should consider this issue since $N_{rom}$ may not be too small, if we want ROM to be relevant. %
Indeed, the trivial case when $N_{rom}$ equals $1$ leads us to choose, according to POD's definition, %
the mean value the interpolated $\chi '(,\rho_j)$ for the single POD vector.

\par
Hence resolution of the optimisation problem, directly or with method of snapshots, would be no longer useful.
